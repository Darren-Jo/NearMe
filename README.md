    <p>Sholinghapuram, shortened to Sholinghur (in Tamil: சோளிங்கப்புரம் or சோளிங்கர்) is a municipality under
        Sholinghur[3] taluk in Ranipet District, Vellore region of Tamil Nadu, India. The town is famous in Tamil Nadu
        and other neighboring states for the Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple.

        Sholinghur is located between Tiruttani (Tamil Nadu) and Chittoor (Andhra Pradesh). This town connects major
        towns and cities like Chennai, Vellore, Arakkonam, Ranipet (Tamil Nadu), and Bengaluru (Karnataka). This
        municipality has 27 wards. In local body elections 2022,DMK won majority by winning 19 wards.

        Etymology
        The first name for this town was Thirukkadigai. This signifies its status as one of the 108 Divya Desams in
        Vaishnavism. The reason behind the name Thirukkadigai is due to one of the following beliefs.

        It is believed by historians that sage Vishwamitra attained title by worshiping Narasimha there for around 45
        minutes.
        It is said in sculptures that saptha rishis had vision and blessings from Lord Narasimha for a duration of time,
        termed as 'Kadigai' (approximately 45 minutes) and hence the name 'Thirukkadigai'.
        It is also believed that Indra, with his demigods, would take a bath in the pushkarni and pray to Narasimha. The
        name of pushkarni is 'Thakkan'.
        The Pushkarni is believed by historians to have medicated water which cures all diseases.
        Budha (son of Chandra) worshipped the deity there and was cured from the curse given by sage Durvasa.
        Many mental disorders, evil acts and prolonged diseases of any kinds are believed to be cured when people take
        bath in the pushkarni and pay obeisance to the lords on the two hillocks.
        During the days of Cholas & Nawabs, the name Thirukkadigai was less used and the name Chozha Singapuram acquired
        prominence.

        Reference is made to a ghatika in the Tiruvallam inscription of Nandivarman Pallavamalla dated in his 61st year.
        Again an arbitrator having the title Trairjyua ghatika madhyasthan is mentioned in three inscriptions of
        Parthivendradhipathi from Brahmadesam in North Arcot District (Kanchipuram district) of Tamil Nadu [4]
        This ghatika was presumably a different one from the famous one at the Pallava capital Kanchipuram. It was
        probably the Ghatikachala at the Sholinghur hill. This place is referred to as Kadigai in the siriya thirumadal
        and periya thirumoli of Vaishnava saint Tirumangai Alvar, a contemporary of Nandivaraman Pallavamalla.
        During the Pallava period it was a well-known centre of Sanskrit learning and stronghold of Vaisnavism.
        The early Vaisnava saint Peyalvar refers to this temple as Pungatikai in his Iyarpa third Andadi.
        Pallava influences are traceable in the neighbourhood of this place. </p>
